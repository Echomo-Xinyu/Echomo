Hello! I'm Xinyu, a penultimate-year Computer Science undergraduate student @[NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My interest lies in *algorithms, backend development and machine learning systems*.

I am currently attending school at NUS and actively learning iOS app development as part of [CS3217 Software Engineering on Modern Application Platforms](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS3217/software-engineering-on-modern-application-platforms). As a side task, I am actively working on [MIT 6.1810 Labs](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2023/schedule.html) and you can find my solutions [here](https://github.com/Echomo-Xinyu/xv6-2023-mit-labs/)
