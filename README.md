Hello! I'm Xinyu, a penultimate-year Computer Science undergraduate student @[NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My interest lies in *algorithms, backend development and machine learning infrastructure*. I am actively seeking out for internship opportunity for the 2024 Summer.

I am currently on exchange @[Viterbi USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) for Fall 2023 and ongoing coursework includes *Introduction to Operating System, Advanced Front-end development(React), and High Performance Computing in Applied Machine Learning*. As part of the OS coursework, I am actively reading the [Operating Systems: Principles and Practice](https://ospp.cs.washington.edu/).
