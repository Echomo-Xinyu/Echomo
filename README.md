Hello! I'm Xinyu, a penultimate-year Computer Science undergraduate student @[NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My interest lies in *algorithms, backend development and machine learning systems*.

I am currently on exchange @[Viterbi USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) for Fall 2023 and ongoing coursework includes *Introduction to Operating System, Advanced Front-end development(React), and High Performance Computing in Applied Machine Learning*. As part of the OS coursework and a side task, I am actively working on [MIT 6.1810 Labs](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.S081/2023/schedule.html) and you can find my solutions [here](https://github.com/Echomo-Xinyu/xv6-2023-mit-labs/)
